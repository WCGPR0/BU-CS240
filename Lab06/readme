Lab06 README

1. Start differs from run in that it creates  a temporary break point.
2. b n, where n is the line number to break
3. continue
4. When just encountering an error, like a logic error for example, you could go back and see the previous stacks
5. info locals prints all the local variables while print allows you to output any expression, variables, etc.\

The fixed program has a segmentation fault. The line commented shows where it happens.
